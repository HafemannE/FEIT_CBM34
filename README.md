# FEIT

FEIT is an open-source platform for solving the forward and inverse problems of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). This version of the software was developed specifically for the Advanced Course at the Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium (CBM). It is built upon basic libraries and tailored to meet the requirements of the course.

For more information, visit the [official FEIT website](https://hafemanne.github.io/FEIT_CBM34/).

### Course Material

The course material includes two Google Colab notebooks, which cover the content of the hands-on practice sessions. One of these notebooks works with real data, providing practical experience in solving Electrical Impedance Tomography problems. You can access the material via the following Google Drive link: [Class Material](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1F0qPyyH4jbbUh5eacI4wp2cQxr7qv9cf).
