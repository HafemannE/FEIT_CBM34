# FEIT

FEIT is an open-source platform for solving the forward and inverse problem of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). This version of the software was developed specifically for the Advanced Course which will be conducted at the Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium (CBM). It is built upon some basic libraries and tailored to meet the requirements of the course.
