`Numpy <https://numpy.org>`_

`Matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org>`_

`FEniCS  <https://fenicsproject.org>`_ 

Desktop
-------------------------------

Before starting to use the codes, it is necessary to install the mentioned libraries.
If you have Windows 10, the installation of FEniCS is done in a Linux subsystem of Windows 10, which can be done following the tutorial on the FEniCS website.

`Installing FEniCS <https://fenicsproject.org/download/archive/>`_

Additionally, initially, we recommend using another tool to start your journey. Since the Linux subsystem does not have a visual interface, you can install Jupyter Notebook to facilitate the process. It is an excellent tool for initial development.

`Jupyter  <https://jupyter.org/index.html>`_
