Welcome to FEIT's documentation!
============================================

FEIT is an open-source platform for solving the forward and inverse problem of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT).
This version of the software was developed specifically for the Advanced Course which will be conducted at the Brazilian Mathematics Colloquium (CBM). It is built upon some basic libraries and tailored to meet the requirements of the course.

This page is still under construction. Please bear in mind that it is currently being debugged, and the codes will be published by 24/07/2023.
